This is the README for the Subsystem_2: Belt Drive
=======

This subsystem aims to optimise the speed of the drum through finding the optimal thickness and material selection.


Main script
-------
The subsystem_2.m MATLAB script should be run for the non-linear regression
The optimisation_fmincon scrip should be run for the initial optimisation

Execution time
-------
The execution time of subsystem_2.m is approximately 6.57 seconds with
The execution time of optimisation_fmincon is approximately 1.72 seconds

(Recorded using 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 professor)

Dependencies
-------
The scripts requires MATLAB_R2018A with the Optimisation Toolbox installed.
